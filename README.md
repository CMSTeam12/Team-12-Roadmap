Empowering SLU Students & Career Services with Data-Driven Insights

## Project Description
HR professionals and recruitment consultants often struggle to keep their hiring strategies in syncwith evolving market trends. They face challenges such as addressing skill shortages and offering competitive compensation to attract top talent. The Employability Analytics Application is designed to tackle these issues by providing actionable insights based on job market trends, professional profiles, salary benchmarks, and industry demand reports. With this tool, HR professionals can make better-informed decisions that not only strengthen recruitment strategies but also help align talent acquisition with their organizationâ€™s broader goals.
